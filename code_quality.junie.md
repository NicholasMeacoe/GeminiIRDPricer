# Code Quality Grade — GeminiIRDPricer

Date: 2025-09-28
Assessor: Junie (JetBrains Autonomous Programmer)


## Executive Summary
Overall, GeminiIRDPricer is a solid, maintainable Flask-based service with clear module boundaries, type hints, configuration via dataclasses, and good validation and security defaults. Test tooling and quality gates (ruff, mypy, pytest with 90% coverage threshold) are present. Primary gaps are documentation drift in README (mentions FastAPI/React), some duplicated helper logic, and opportunities to standardize structured logging and CI security checks.

Final grade: B+ (3.8 / 5.0)


## Grading Rubric and Scores
Scale per category: 0 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Weighted average gives overall score.

- Architecture & Design (weight 0.15) — 4.0
  - Clear separation: web, services (DI), domain (parsing/pricer/utils), config. App factory pattern. Minor duplication in curve file discovery lowers score slightly.

- Code Quality & Maintainability (weight 0.15) — 4.0
  - Strong typing, dataclasses, small functions, defensive programming. Lint/typecheck configs present. Could further standardize logging patterns and reduce small duplications.

- Testing & Coverage (weight 0.15) — 4.0
  - Pytest with coverage fail-under=90% configured. Suite appears reasonably comprehensive for core modules; can expand for error contracts and edge cases. (Assumes tests in /tests reflect current code.)

- Security Posture (weight 0.15) — 3.5
  - Security headers, CSP default in prod, optional Basic Auth, input validation including path traversal guard. Improvements: rate limiting, bandit/pip-audit in CI, cap notionals by config.

- Documentation (weight 0.10) — 3.0
  - Rich recommendations docs and plans, but README is misaligned (claims FastAPI/React). Needs an authoritative Flask-focused README and brief ARCHITECTURE/CONFIG docs.

- Observability (Logging & Metrics) (weight 0.10) — 3.8
  - Request/latency Prometheus metrics and access logs; JSON format option. Improve by standardizing JSON formatting for all loggers and adding error logging with request_id; possibly a build_info metric.

- Performance & Reliability (weight 0.05) — 3.8
  - Efficient enough for scope; LRU+TTL curve cache with thread safety. Numerics well-factored with strategies; ACT/ACT noted as approximate. Document limitations; optional cache ops hook.

- Dependency & Build Hygiene (weight 0.10) — 4.2
  - Runtime deps pinned. Dev tooling present (nox, ruff, mypy). Add pinned dev requirements, security scans, optional lock file.

- DevEx & CI/CD (weight 0.05) — 3.5
  - nox sessions defined; easy local workflows. Add CI matrix to run lint, typecheck, tests, security tools; add containerization guidance.

Weighted score calculation:
- 0.15*4.0 + 0.15*4.0 + 0.15*4.0 + 0.15*3.5 + 0.10*3.0 + 0.10*3.8 + 0.05*3.8 + 0.10*4.2 + 0.05*3.5
- = 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.525 + 0.30 + 0.38 + 0.19 + 0.42 + 0.175 = 3.79 ≈ 3.8/5.0

Letter grade mapping: A (4.5–5.0), A- (4.2–4.49), B+ (3.7–4.19), B (3.3–3.69), B- (3.0–3.29)


## Key Strengths
- Strong module boundaries and DI container (Services) enabling testability.
- Sensible defaults and safe-guards: path traversal checks, CSP defaults in prod, optional auth, numeric validations, capped points/rates.
- Observability built in: request counters/latency, cache metrics, structured access logging option, request IDs.
- Tooling: ruff, mypy (strict), pytest with high coverage gate, nox sessions.
- Pinned runtime dependencies.


## Primary Improvement Areas
- Align documentation with actual Flask stack; remove FastAPI/React claims or relegate to roadmap.
- Unify curve file discovery by using utils.find_curve_file in all callers (remove local duplicates).
- Standardize JSON logging handlers/formatters for app and access logs with correlation fields (request_id, env, version).
- Add CI security/static analysis steps (bandit, pip-audit) and pin dev requirements.
- Provide containerization/readiness docs and rate limiting guidance for production.


## Quick Wins (next 1–2 hours)
- Update README to Flask reality; add Quick Start with start-*.bat and curl examples.
- Replace web._find_curve_file/cli helpers with utils.find_curve_file.
- Add a small JsonFormatter and wire when LOG_FORMAT=json.
- Create requirements-dev.txt with pinned tooling and run bandit/pip-audit locally.
